## Memory Management, Pointers and Types in C


### Strengths

Complete control over manual memory management.

No lifetimes.

Less compiler complexity, meaning faster builds.

Weakly typed meaning easy casting between types.


### Weaknesses

No RAII or region based memory management makes it easy to not free memory.

Pointers can point be null.

No concept of mutable reference.

No borrow checker.
