## Getting Started

To simply get the PDF notes, look below for the subject you require and click the link.

### Running locally

All notes are written in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) and can be compiled using the Typst CLI.

Head over to [Typst's installation guide](https://github.com/typst/typst/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for instructions on how to install the Typst CLI on your system.

Once you have Typst installed, you can compile the notes by running the following command in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
make compile
```

This will compile all `.typ` files in the repository and create a corresponding `.pdf` file in the same directory.

## Downloadable Notes

If you see any issues in the notes, please create an [issue](https://github.com/MatthewMckee4/exam_notes/issues).
